# Soil Moisture Manager
This is an Ardunio project that measures soil moisture to determine if the plant needs to be watered. It's designed to be a data-driven support system for the various plants I'd like to care for. By being able to consistently deliver desired moisture conditions into soil, I hope to keep plants growing on auto-pilot with various tweaks to threshholds.

## Project Features Planned
- Support for multiple moisture sensors with synthesized values reported to an LCD screen
- A water pump that hydrates plants until ideal moisture threshold is reached
- A hosted web interface with values and event history being displayed
